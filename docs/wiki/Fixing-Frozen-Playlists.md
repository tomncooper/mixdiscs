# Fixing Frozen Playlists

Your remote Spotify playlist shows a ⚠️ warning? It's "frozen" because it now exceeds 80 minutes.

## What Does "Frozen" Mean?

When you update your Spotify playlist and it goes over 80 minutes, Mixdiscs shows the last valid version (before it exceeded the limit) instead of removing it entirely.

## How to Fix

**Simple**: Just remove tracks from your Spotify playlist until it's under 80 minutes.

1. Click the "🔗 Remote" link on the frozen playlist
2. Remove enough tracks to get under 80:00
3. Wait for the next site update (happens automatically)
4. Your playlist will unfreeze automatically

**No PR needed!** The fix happens on Spotify, not GitHub.

## Visual Indicators

Frozen playlists show:
- ⚠️ Warning icon next to title
- "📌 Showing cached version from [date]" notice
- Tooltip with how much you're over the limit
